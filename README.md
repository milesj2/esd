# ESD
The below is guidance for various aspects of the project

## Branch naming standard
Naming of branches will be based on the issue number assigned to the work you are doing, and the label on this work. It's important to note branch names shouldn't be too long and spaces should not be used a - will replace a space. The format will be:
\<label\>/\<issuenumber\>-short-desc-of-issue 

IE: feature/7-initilise-basic-web-code

## Commit naming standard
Commit's will follow a similar method, to ensure commits can easily be traced back to an issue in the future all commit's will be tagged by the issue number followed by a space and then a short description IE:
"7 create basic template"

Doing the above will allow easy maintainance and a consistent look throughout the whole project.
